# Twitter sentiment analysis with BERT

This repo contains resources to further pre-train and fine-tune the BERT model for twitter sentiment analysis.
The code was written/adapted prior to tensorflow team lauching the "classify text with bert" [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/classify_text_with_bert). 
If you'd like a simpler method for training the BERT model for TSA, I'd recommend you to follow the mentioned guide. 
I plan to implement this code according to such, in the near future.
